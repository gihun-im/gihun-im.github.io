Hi there! 👋 I am a second-year PhD student in the Counseling Psychology program (APA-accredited) at [The University of Iowa](https://education.uiowa.edu/areas-study/counseling-and-mental-health/counseling-psychology). I am also a certified school counselor (전문상담교사 in Korean) and previously worked at the headquarters office of [Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education](https://english.sen.go.kr/english/index.do) for 3 years. Before moving to the U.S., I completed my master's degree in Educational Counseling at [Seoul National University](https://learning.snu.ac.kr) in 2024.

My research interests lie on three key themes:

-   Uncovering oppression & resilience across marginalized spaces, particularly LGBTQ+ communities 🏳️‍🌈
-   Developing the foundations of social justice advocacy training for practitioners 🧑‍🏫
-   Amplifying underrepresented voices through participatory research 📣

In practice, I am passionate about exploring and discussing the complexities of multiple identities, power dynamics, oppression, and liberation in therapy.

[I strongly believe in the transformative power of both research and practice to help people reclaim their voices and empower themselves.]{color="#FFD479"}
