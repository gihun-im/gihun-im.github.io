Korean school counselors‚Äô counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth: Latent Profile Analysis.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe purpose of this study was to classify school counselors into latent groups based on their counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth, and to explore the effects of certain characteristics on the classifications. A comprehensive survey was given to 259 school counselors. Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), the data was classified into potential groups, and subsequent analysis with the R3STEP method identified factors that significantly influenced group classification. Data analysis via LPA revealed five latent groups among school counselors, labeled as ‚ÄúDistant,‚Äù ‚ÄúPassive,‚Äù ‚ÄúAverage,‚Äù ‚ÄúActive,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdvocacy-oriented.‚Äù Factors that influenced the classification of the groups included sexual orientation and gender identity, the logarithmic value of counseling experiences with LGBTQ+ clients, and school level advocacy. The findings led to discussions on educational and training approaches to enhance school counselors‚Äô counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth."

Impact of discussion activity in international youth exchange programs on global citizenship: Mediating role of multicultural competence. Journal of Education & Culture, 31(1), 597-613.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis study explored the impact of participation in discussion activities within international youth exchange programs on global citizenship, focusing on the mediating role of multicultural competence. We collected and analyzed data using responses from 75 participants across 41 countries who completed pre- and post-program surveys. Correlation analysis was followed by mediation analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the mediation effect. The key findings are as follows. First, multicultural competence partially mediated the relationship between discussion activity and global citizenship. Second, sensitivity analysis showed that the direct effect was robust, while the indirect effect was sensitive to omitted confounders. These findings provide insights into the role of discussion activities in fostering global citizenship. Finally, we discussed the implications, limitations, and directions for future research."

    "text": "Award Alert!\n\n\n\nThis project was awarded the Distinguished Student Research Award by Korea Employment Information Service in 2024.\nThe recent expanded model of the Psychology of Working Theory (PWT; Duffy et al., 2022)1 incorporates the concept of decent education to better understand how education influences career outcomes and overall well-being. Decent education refers not only to formal education but also to skills, training, and learning opportunities that help individuals secure stable and meaningful work. The expanded model highlights that decent education provides individuals with the necessary resources, knowledge, and skills to navigate the job market effectively.\nWe applied the expanded model of the PWT to young people in South Korea. The goal was to examine whether the pathways to obtaining decent work, as outlined by the theory, differ between young men and women. Specifically, we investigated whether work volition and career adaptability mediate the relationship between decent education and decent work. We used data from the Youth Panel Survey 2021 (Hwang et al., 2021)2 and focused on 3,403 Korean young adults currently employed as regular workers (Ï†ïÍ∑úÏßÅ in Korean). The group included 1,901 women and 1,502 men, with an average age of 25.32 years.\nWe are currently preparing for submission based on the analyzed results."

Newman Research Award by the University of Iowa College of Education in 2024.\nIn May 2021, during early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, a news outlet publicly identified a COVID-19 patient as a ‚Äúgay man‚Äù who visited gay clubs in Itaewon, disclosing personal details. This led to significant online hate against the LGBTQ+ community, heightening fear of contracting COVID-19 within this group. Using the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003)1, this project investigates how minority stressors, such as the perceived threat of COVID-19, affect contextual factors like internalized stigma and contribute to mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people. Also, I aim to examine the moderating role of protective factors, such as community connectedness, in these relationships.\nI will use data from the 2021 Youth LGBTQ+ People‚Äôs Social Needs and Status Survey (Jeong et al., 2021)2, which surveyed 3,911 LGBTQ+ people aged 19-34 in South Korea. For analysis, I will use SPSS 27.0, Mplus, and R to test the mediating effects of minority stressors and the moderating effects of protective factors."

    "text": "Sexual orientation laws in the world (ILGA, 2020)\n\n\nThis project focuses on the diverse experiences of LGBTQ+ people worldwide and highlights the importance of providing supportive and inclusive psychological care. While some countries have strong legal protections for LGBTQ+ people, others either criminalize LGBTQ+ identities or remain neutral, offering no protections or penalties. South Korea is an example of a neutral country where LGBTQ+ rights are not explicitly protected, yet discrimination and societal stigma remain significant challenges.\nIn South Korea, negative attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people are common, particularly among conservative and religious groups, despite increasing acceptance among younger generations. There is no anti-discrimination law, conversion therapy is still practiced, and LGBTQ+ issues are rarely included in psychological research or training programs. These gaps make it difficult for psychologists to offer competent, affirmative care.\nWe aim to suggest practical steps for practitioners to create more inclusive and supportive environments. Examples include reflecting on personal biases, seeking professional development, using inclusive language, and integrating frameworks like the minority stress model into practice. We believe that adopting these strategies and advocating for change can help practitioners improve mental health care for LGBTQ+ people, even in regions with limited legal protections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Works\n\n\n\n\nKoch, J.

Our research specifically focused on suggesting the subjects of a standardized curriculum for youth counselors by analyzing previous studies and the opinions of practitioners in the field. To identify the subjects of the curriculum, we first implemented a needs assessment to gather the opinions of professors and practitioners. We then developed a standardized curriculum with five sections and subjects based on analyzing previous studies and the needs assessment. We employed the Delphi method to determine the final curriculum by modifying eligibility criteria, syllabus components, and youth counselors‚Äô competencies. Finally, we discussed the implications of these findings relative to the systematic application of the curriculum."

Disability & Employment, 35(1), 163-186.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: People with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF) have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships with others. These traits make it difficult for young adults with BIF to transition into adulthood, including academic careers and employment. However, there is still a lack of programs promoting social competence for them. Therefore, this study aims to develop a program to support the social development of young adults with BIF.\nMethod: To this end, this study first conducted a literature review to identify the components of social enrichment programs. Then, we implemented a needs assessment among the subjects. Based on the results of the literature review and needs analysis, we developed a social enrichment program based on SEL (Social Emotional Learning), CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) for a total of 12 sessions. To pilot the program, we asked for cooperation from two organizations that support people with borderline intellectual functioning and recruited three instructors and 11 participants for the pilot. After piloting the program, we identified changes in participants‚Äô social factors and conducted interviews to explore their experiences with the program. Based on the results of the pilot, we refined the program and developed the final program.\nResults: Participants‚Äô social awareness post-test scores increased significantly after participating in the program. Observer responses showed significant gains in all factors of the social competence scale. Analysis of participant interviews revealed that participants learned how to communicate and get along with people after participating in the program.\nImplications: This study is noteworthy because it developed a program to strengthen the social skills of young adults with BIF and validated the program‚Äôs applicability in the field through a pilot study."
