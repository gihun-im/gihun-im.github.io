    "section": "",
    "text": "Award Alert!\n\n\n\nThis project was awarded the Lee Chang Kook Fund: Queer Research Grant by the Beyond the Rainbow Foundation in 2025.\nLGBTQ+ teachers often act as advocates and visible role models for LGBTQ+ students, yet they continue to face marginalization within heteronormative school systems. Many experience hostility rooted in identity-based stigma and must constantly balance their professional responsibilities with the concealment or negotiation of stigmatized aspects of themselves. Although existing research has emphasized these difficulties and called for institutional support, inclusive training, and safer school climates, most scholarship has emerged from Western, predominantly White contexts, limiting its cross-cultural applicability.\nIn South Korea, teaching is regarded as a respected and stable government profession deeply influenced by Confucian values, attracting many LGBTQ+ individuals seeking social legitimacy and financial security. Yet for queer teachers, this respectability often clashes with the silence surrounding LGBTQ+ identities in schools. The tension between public prestige and personal erasure remains poorly understood. Moreover, existing studies tend to frame LGBTQ+ teachers primarily as victims of oppression, paying less attention to their coping strategies, acts of resistance, and sources of community support. The predominant use of interview-based methods also constrains how deeply scholars can access the lived realities of these educators under systemic constraints.\nTo address these limitations, I will conduct a qualitative photovoice study with approximately 8 members of QTQ (Queer Teachers with Queers) a peer support network for LGBTQ+ educators in South Korea. Photovoice, which integrates photography with narrative reflection, will allow participants to document their experiences and engage in group discussions that foster collective meaning-making. Using the PHOTO framework (Graziano, 20041; Hussey, 20062), I will facilitate group interviews and, with consent, curate participants’ photographs on Padlet in collaboration with QTQ for public exhibition.\nThis study aims to generate culturally situated insights into the professional and personal lives of LGBTQ+ teachers in South Korea. By centering their agency and resilience, it seeks to move beyond deficit-oriented perspectives and highlight how these educators draw upon community networks and creative strategies to sustain themselves. The findings are expected to inform inclusive educational policy, teacher training, and institutional support systems. Ultimately, by amplifying teachers’ own voices, this research will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of both the struggles and strengths of LGBTQ+ educators working in non-Western school contexts."

Newman Research Award by the University of Iowa College of Education in 2024.\nIn May 2021, during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, a major news outlet publicly identified a patient as a “gay man” who had visited several gay clubs in Itaewon, revealing personal information without consent. The disclosure triggerd a surge of online hostility toward the LGBTQ+ community, deepening stigma and intensifying fears of infection among its members. Guided by the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003)1, this project examines how minority stressors, such as the perceived threat of COVID-19, shape internalized stigma and, in turn, influence mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people. The project also explores whether protective factors, including community connectedness, buffer these adverse effects.\nI will use data from the 2021 Youth LGBTQ+ People’s Social Needs and Status Survey (Jeong et al., 2021)2, which includes responses from 3,911 LGBTQ+ people aged 19 to 34 in South Korea. For analysis, I will use SPSS 27.0, Mplus, and R to test the mediating effects of minority stressors and the moderating roles of protective factors in these relationships."

Disability & Employment, 35(1), 163-186.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: People with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships with others. These traits make it difficult for young adults with BIF to transition into adulthood, including academic careers and employment. However, there is still a lack of programs promoting social competence for them. Therefore, this study aims to develop a program to support the social development of young adults with BIF.\nMethod: To this end, this study first conducted a literature review to identify the components of social enrichment programs. Then, we implemented a needs assessment among the subjects. Based on the results of the literature review and needs analysis, we developed a social enrichment program based on social emotional learning (SEL), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for a total of 12 sessions. To pilot the program, we asked for cooperation from two organizations that support people with borderline intellectual functioning and recruited three instructors and 11 participants for the pilot. After piloting the program, we identified changes in participants’ social factors and conducted interviews to explore their experiences with the program. Based on the results of the pilot, we refined the program and developed the final program.\nResults: Participants’ social awareness post-test scores increased significantly after participating in the program. Observer responses showed significant gains in all factors of the social competence scale. Analysis of participant interviews revealed that participants learned how to communicate and get along with people after participating in the program.\nImplications: This study is noteworthy because it developed a program to strengthen the social skills of young adults with BIF and validated the program’s applicability in the field through a pilot study."

Our research specifically focused on suggesting the subjects of a standardized curriculum for youth counselors by analyzing previous studies and the opinions of practitioners in the field. To identify the subjects of the curriculum, we first implemented a needs assessment to gather the opinions of professors and practitioners. We then developed a standardized curriculum with five sections and subjects based on analyzing previous studies and the needs assessment. We employed the Delphi method to determine the final curriculum by modifying eligibility criteria, syllabus components, and youth counselors’ competencies. Finally, we discussed the implications of these findings relative to the systematic application of the curriculum."

We collected and analyzed data using responses from 75 participants across 41 countries who completed pre- and post-program surveys. Correlation analysis was followed by mediation analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the mediation effect. The key findings are as follows. First, multicultural competence partially mediated the relationship between discussion activity and global citizenship. Second, sensitivity analysis showed that the direct effect was robust, while the indirect effect was sensitive to omitted confounders. These findings provide insights into the role of discussion activities in fostering global citizenship. Finally, we discussed the implications, limitations, and directions for future research."

Korean school counselors’ counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth: Latent Profile Analysis.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis study classified Korean school counselors into latent groups based on their LGBTQ+ counseling competencies and advocacy activities through latent profile analysis (LPA). Data from 259 school counselors were analyzed, resulting in five distinct groups: Distant, Passive, Average, Active, and Advocacy-oriented. R3STEP analyses further showed that counselors’ sexual orientation and gender identity, counseling experience with LGBTQ+ clients, exposure to LGBTQ+ education, and school level significantly predicted group membership. Among these, education exposure emerged as the strongest predictor across groups. Based on these profiles and predictors, the study proposes developmentally tailored educational recommendations and training considerations to strengthen both competence and advocacy. Implications for counselor education, research, and practice, as well as study limitations, are discussed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Resilience is a protective process that enables young people to adapt and grow in the face of adversity, supporting their healthy development and well-being. From a social-ecological perspective, resilience develops through interactions across multiple systems, including individual, relational, and structural levels, and requires coordinated efforts within and across these domains (Brennan, 2007)1. Community organizations are central to this process. By addressing systemic inequities and connecting public resources with those most affected, they help reduce disparities in access to care and promote fairer developmental outcomes for youth.\nAlthough resilience has gained recognition as a key concept in youth development, community-based interventions remain underrepresented in the literature. Definitions and measurements of resilience also vary widely, making it difficult to compare findings across studies. To address these gaps, our study will conduct a scoping review of community-based programs designed to strengthen youth resilience. We are identifying relevant studies from PsycINFO and Scopus and will analyze them according to intervention type, outcome measures, and contextual factors influencing effectiveness.\nThe goal is to identify common components such as social support, interpersonal skill building, and empowerment that reflect central processes of resilience. The findings are expected to inform evidence-based frameworks and guide policy development for future community-based programs that promote youth resilience more equitably and effectively."

Decent education encompasses not only formal schooling but also access to skill development, vocational training, and other learning opportunities that enable individuals to secure stable and meaningful employment. Within this framework, decent education functions as a foundation that equips people with the resources, knowledge, and competencies needed to navigate the labor market effectively.\nIn this study, we applied the expanded PWT model to young adults in South Korea to examine whether pathways to decent work differ by gender. Our analysis focused on whether work volition and career adaptability mediate the link between decent education and decent work. Data were drawn from the Youth Panel Survey 2021 (Hwang et al., 2021)2, which included 3,403 Korean young adults employed in regular positions (정규직 in Korean). The sample comprised 1,901 women and 1,502 men, with a mean age of 25.32 years.\nWe are currently preparing for submission based on the analyzed results."

National figures show that fewer than half of Hispanic and Black students, and under one-fifth of low-income students, earn a degree within six years. Institutional efforts to improve retention have made limited progress, often sidestepping the structural racism and classism embedded in academic systems that shape students’ daily realities.\nCommunity-based organizations (CBOs) have stepped into this gap, developing College Success Programs (CSPs) that accompany students beyond admission. Grounded in community trust and culturally responsive approaches, these programs aim to sustain persistence and improve degree attainment. Early evidence points to their promise, yet systematic evaluation of how these programs operate and which elements most influence student outcomes remains scarce.\nThis mixed-method study seeks to address that absence. It will examine how CBO-led CSPs conceptualize, enact, and maintain college success among underrepresented students. The study will analyze which conditions CBOs identify as central to persistence, what specific supports they offer, how students experience those supports, and what measurable effects emerge in graduation data. The broader aim is to distill effective strategies that can inform institutional policy and guide both educational systems and community organizations in fostering equitable pathways to degree completion for students of color and those from lower-income families."
