Korean school counselors‚Äô counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth: Latent Profile Analysis.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe purpose of this study was to classify school counselors into latent groups based on their counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth, and to explore the effects of certain characteristics on the classifications. A comprehensive survey was given to 259 school counselors. Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), the data was classified into potential groups, and subsequent analysis with the R3STEP method identified factors that significantly influenced group classification. Data analysis via LPA revealed five latent groups among school counselors, labeled as ‚ÄúDistant,‚Äù ‚ÄúPassive,‚Äù ‚ÄúAverage,‚Äù ‚ÄúActive,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdvocacy-oriented.‚Äù Factors that influenced the classification of the groups included sexual orientation and gender identity, the logarithmic value of counseling experiences with LGBTQ+ clients, and school level advocacy. The findings led to discussions on educational and training approaches to enhance school counselors‚Äô counseling competencies and advocacy activities for LGBTQ+ youth."

Impact of discussion activity in international youth exchange programs on global citizenship: Mediating role of multicultural competence. Journal of Education & Culture, 31(1), 597-613.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis study explored the impact of participation in discussion activities within international youth exchange programs on global citizenship, focusing on the mediating role of multicultural competence. We collected and analyzed data using responses from 75 participants across 41 countries who completed pre- and post-program surveys. Correlation analysis was followed by mediation analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the mediation effect. The key findings are as follows. First, multicultural competence partially mediated the relationship between discussion activity and global citizenship. Second, sensitivity analysis showed that the direct effect was robust, while the indirect effect was sensitive to omitted confounders. These findings provide insights into the role of discussion activities in fostering global citizenship. Finally, we discussed the implications, limitations, and directions for future research."

Decent education refers not only to formal education but also to skills, training, and learning opportunities that help individuals secure stable and meaningful work. The expanded model highlights that decent education provides individuals with the necessary resources, knowledge, and skills to navigate the job market effectively.\nWe applied the expanded model of the PWT to young people in South Korea. The goal was to examine whether the pathways to obtaining decent work, as outlined by the theory, differ between young men and women. Specifically, we investigated whether work volition and career adaptability mediate the relationship between decent education and decent work. We used data from the Youth Panel Survey 2021 (Hwang et al., 2021)2 and focused on 3,403 Korean young adults currently employed as regular workers (Ï†ïÍ∑úÏßÅ in Korean). The group included 1,901 women and 1,502 men, with an average age of 25.32 years.\nWe are currently preparing for submission based on the analyzed results."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Resilience is a protective process that enables youth to adapt and thrive amid adversity, supporting their positive development. From a social-ecological perspective, resilience emerges through interactions across multiple systems, requiring coordinated efforts at individual, relational, and structural levels(Brennan, 2007)1. Community organizations play a critical role in this process by addressing systemic inequities and bridging gaps between public services and individuals. Their locally grounded efforts can reduce disparities in access to care and promote more equitable developmental outcomes for youth.\nGiven the limited attention to community-based programs in existing reviews and the inconsistent definitions and measurements of resilience across studies, our study will conduct a scoping review of community-based interventions that promote youth resilience. We are identifying relevant studies from PsycINFO and Scopus and will analyze them based on intervention type, outcome measures, and contextual influences on effectiveness. We aim to identify common components‚Äîsuch as social support, interpersonal skill-building, and empowerment‚Äîthat align with key aspects of resilience. The findings will offer insights to inform evidence-based frameworks and policies for future community-based interventions."

Using the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003)1, this project investigates how minority stressors, such as the perceived threat of COVID-19, affect contextual factors like internalized stigma and contribute to mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people. Also, I aim to examine the moderating role of protective factors, such as community connectedness, in these relationships.\nI will use data from the 2021 Youth LGBTQ+ People‚Äôs Social Needs and Status Survey (Jeong et al., 2021)2, which surveyed 3,911 LGBTQ+ people aged 19-34 in South Korea.

    "text": "Award Alert!\n\n\n\nThis project was awarded the Lee Chang Kook Fund: Queer Research Grant by the Beyond the Rainbow Foundation in 2025.\nLGBTQ+ teachers can serve as advocates and role models for LGBTQ+ students, yet they remain marginalized in heteronormative school settings. Many face identity-based hostility and must juggle their roles as educators with managing stigmatized aspects of themselves. While research has highlighted these challenges and called for institutional support, inclusive training, and safer school climates, most studies focus on Western, predominantly White contexts, which limits their broader relevance.\nIn South Korea, teaching is a respected and stable government profession shaped by Confucian values, making it an appealing career path for many LGBTQ+ individuals. However, queer teachers often navigate a stark tension between the profession‚Äôs prestige and the invisibility of LGBTQ+ identities in schools. This contradiction between public respectability and personal erasure remains understudied. Existing research also tends to frame LGBTQ+ teachers mainly as victims, overlooking their coping strategies and support networks. In addition, the reliance on interviews often fails to capture the full depth of their daily realities under systemic oppression.\nTo address these gaps, I will conduct a qualitative photovoice study with around 8 members of QTQ (Queer Teachers with Queers) a peer support group for LGBTQ+ educators in South Korea. Photovoice, which combines photography and storytelling, will enable participants to visually document their experiences and engage in collective dialogue. Using the PHOTO framework(Graziano, 20041; Hussey, 20062), I will facilitate group interviews and, with consent, exhibit participants‚Äô photographs online via Padlet in collaboration with QTQ.\nThis study will offer culturally grounded insights into the lives of LGBTQ+ teachers in South Korea. It will move beyond deficit-based narratives by highlighting their resilience and use of community resources. Findings will have implications for inclusive school policies, teacher training, and support systems. By centering teachers‚Äô voices, the project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of both the challenges and strengths of LGBTQ+ educators in non-Western contexts."

Our research specifically focused on suggesting the subjects of a standardized curriculum for youth counselors by analyzing previous studies and the opinions of practitioners in the field. To identify the subjects of the curriculum, we first implemented a needs assessment to gather the opinions of professors and practitioners. We then developed a standardized curriculum with five sections and subjects based on analyzing previous studies and the needs assessment. We employed the Delphi method to determine the final curriculum by modifying eligibility criteria, syllabus components, and youth counselors‚Äô competencies. Finally, we discussed the implications of these findings relative to the systematic application of the curriculum."

Disability & Employment, 35(1), 163-186.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: People with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF) have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships with others. These traits make it difficult for young adults with BIF to transition into adulthood, including academic careers and employment. However, there is still a lack of programs promoting social competence for them. Therefore, this study aims to develop a program to support the social development of young adults with BIF.\nMethod: To this end, this study first conducted a literature review to identify the components of social enrichment programs. Then, we implemented a needs assessment among the subjects. Based on the results of the literature review and needs analysis, we developed a social enrichment program based on SEL (Social Emotional Learning), CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) for a total of 12 sessions. To pilot the program, we asked for cooperation from two organizations that support people with borderline intellectual functioning and recruited three instructors and 11 participants for the pilot. After piloting the program, we identified changes in participants‚Äô social factors and conducted interviews to explore their experiences with the program. Based on the results of the pilot, we refined the program and developed the final program.\nResults: Participants‚Äô social awareness post-test scores increased significantly after participating in the program. Observer responses showed significant gains in all factors of the social competence scale. Analysis of participant interviews revealed that participants learned how to communicate and get along with people after participating in the program.\nImplications: This study is noteworthy because it developed a program to strengthen the social skills of young adults with BIF and validated the program‚Äôs applicability in the field through a pilot study."
