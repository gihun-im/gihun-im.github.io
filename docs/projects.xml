<p>LGBTQ+ teachers can serve as advocates and role models for LGBTQ+ students, yet they remain marginalized in heteronormative school settings. Many face identity-based hostility and must juggle their roles as educators with managing stigmatized aspects of themselves. While research has highlighted these challenges and called for institutional support, inclusive training, and safer school climates, most studies focus on Western, predominantly White contexts, which limits their broader relevance.</p>
<p>In South Korea, teaching is a respected and stable government profession shaped by Confucian values, making it an appealing career path for many LGBTQ+ individuals. However, queer teachers often navigate a stark tension between the profession’s prestige and the invisibility of LGBTQ+ identities in schools. This contradiction between public respectability and personal erasure remains understudied. Existing research also tends to frame LGBTQ+ teachers mainly as victims, overlooking their coping strategies and support networks. In addition, the reliance on interviews often fails to capture the full depth of their daily realities under systemic oppression.</p>
<p>To address these gaps, I will conduct a qualitative photovoice study with around 8 members of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qtq_rainbow/">QTQ</a> (Queer Teachers with Queers) a peer support group for LGBTQ+ educators in South Korea. Photovoice, which combines photography and storytelling, will enable participants to visually document their experiences and engage in collective dialogue. Using the PHOTO framework (<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F1099-9809.10.3.302">Graziano, 2004</a><sup>1</sup>; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v51n01_07">Hussey, 2006</a><sup>2</sup>), I will facilitate group interviews and, with consent, exhibit participants’ photographs online via Padlet in collaboration with QTQ.</p>
<p>This study will offer culturally grounded insights into the lives of LGBTQ+ teachers in South Korea. It will move beyond deficit-based narratives by highlighting their resilience and use of community resources. Findings will have implications for inclusive school policies, teacher training, and support systems. By centering teachers’ voices, the project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of both the challenges and strengths of LGBTQ+ educators in non-Western contexts.</p>

  <title>CBI for Youth Resilience</title>

<p>Resilience is a protective process that enables youth to adapt and thrive amid adversity, supporting their positive development. From a social-ecological perspective, resilience emerges through interactions across multiple systems, requiring coordinated efforts at individual, relational, and structural levels (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13575270701733732">Brennan, 2007</a>)<sup>1</sup>. Community organizations play a critical role in this process by addressing systemic inequities and bridging gaps between public services and individuals. Their locally grounded efforts can reduce disparities in access to care and promote more equitable developmental outcomes for youth.</p>
<p>Given the limited attention to community-based programs in existing reviews and the inconsistent definitions and measurements of resilience across studies, our study will conduct a scoping review of community-based interventions that promote youth resilience. We are identifying relevant studies from PsycINFO and Scopus and will analyze them based on intervention type, outcome measures, and contextual influences on effectiveness. We aim to identify common components such as social support, interpersonal skill-building, and empowerment that align with key aspects of resilience. The findings will offer insights to inform evidence-based frameworks and policies for future community-based interventions.</p>

<p>Since the 2015 legalization of same-sex marraige in the U.S., societal and legal shifts have changed the context of LGBTQ+ partner loss. Building on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269216316634601">Bristowe et al.’s (2016)</a><sup>1</sup> systematic review, we examined reserach on LGBTQ+ bereavement published after 2015.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.prisma-statement.org">PRISMA guidelines</a>, we screened 1,656 studies from Psychology Database and PubMed, ultimately including 10 qualitative studies. Thematic analysis identified common bereavement reactions and LGBTQ+-specific experiences. Findings highlight the need for professional education and interventions tailored to the unique grief experiences of LGBTQ+ people, even in an era of increased legal recognition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #FFD479;">We are currently preparing for submission based on the analyzed results.</span></p>

<p>In May 2021, during early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, a news outlet publicly identified a COVID-19 patient as a “gay man” who visited gay clubs in Itaewon, disclosing personal details. This led to significant online hate against the LGBTQ+ community, heightening fear of contracting COVID-19 within this group. Using the Minority Stress Model (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2072932/">Meyer, 2003</a>)<sup>1</sup>, this project investigates how <strong>minority stressors</strong>, such as the perceived threat of COVID-19, affect contextual factors like internalized stigma and contribute to mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people. Also, I aim to examine the moderating role of <strong>protective factors</strong>, such as community connectedness, in these relationships.</p>

<figcaption>Decent education within PWT model (Duffy et al., 2022)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The recent expanded model of the psychology of working theory (PWT; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879122000823">Duffy et al., 2022</a>)<sup>1</sup> incorporates the concept of <strong>decent education</strong> to better understand how education influences career outcomes and overall well-being. Decent education refers not only to formal education but also to skills, training, and learning opportunities that help individuals secure stable and meaningful work. The expanded model highlights that decent education provides individuals with the necessary resources, knowledge, and skills to navigate the job market effectively.</p>
<p>We applied the expanded model of the PWT to young people in South Korea. The goal was to examine whether the pathways to obtaining decent work, as outlined by the theory, differ between young men and women. Specifically, we investigated whether work volition and career adaptability mediate the relationship between decent education and decent work. We used data from the <em>Youth Panel Survey 2021</em> (<a href="https://survey.keis.or.kr/eng/yp/yp01.jsp">Hwang et al., 2021</a>)<sup>2</sup> and focused on 3,403 Korean young adults currently employed as regular workers (정규직 in Korean). The group included 1,901 women and 1,502 men, with an average age of 25.32 years.</p>
