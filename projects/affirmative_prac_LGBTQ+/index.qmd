This project focuses on the diverse experiences of LGBTQ+ people worldwide and highlights the importance of providing supportive and inclusive psychological care. While some countries have strong legal protections for LGBTQ+ people, others either criminalize LGBTQ+ identities or remain neutral, offering no protections or penalties. South Korea is an example of a **neutral** country where LGBTQ+ rights are not explicitly protected, yet discrimination and societal stigma remain significant challenges.

In South Korea, negative attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people are common, particularly among conservative and religious groups, despite increasing acceptance among younger generations. There is no [anti-discrimination law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law), [conversion therapy](https://glaad.org/reference/conversion-therapy/) is still practiced, and LGBTQ+ issues are rarely included in psychological research or training programs. These gaps make it difficult for psychologists to offer competent, affirmative care.

We aim to suggest practical steps for practitioners to create more inclusive and supportive environments. Examples include reflecting on personal biases, seeking professional development, using inclusive language, and integrating frameworks like the minority stress model into practice. We believe that adopting these strategies and advocating for change can help practitioners improve mental health care for LGBTQ+ people, even in regions with limited legal protections.
