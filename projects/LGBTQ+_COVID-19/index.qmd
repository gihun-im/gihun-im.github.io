In May 2021, during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, a major news outlet publicly identified a patient as a "gay man" who had visited several gay clubs in Itaewon, revealing personal information without consent. The disclosure triggerd a surge of online hostility toward the LGBTQ+ community, deepening stigma and intensifying fears of infection among its members. Guided by the Minority Stress Model ([Meyer, 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2072932/))[^1], this project examines how **minority stressors**, such as the perceived threat of COVID-19, shape internalized stigma and, in turn, influence mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people. The project also explores whether **protective factors**, including community connectedness, buffer these adverse effects.

I will use data from the *2021 Youth LGBTQ+ People's Social Needs and Status Survey* ([Jeong et al., 2021](https://www.dawoom-t4c.org/397d4ebb-6ad4-4525-9b71-9706f13a5e8b))[^2], which includes responses from 3,911 LGBTQ+ people aged 19 to 34 in South Korea. For analysis, I will use SPSS 27.0, Mplus, and R to test the mediating effects of minority stressors and the moderating roles of protective factors in these relationships.
