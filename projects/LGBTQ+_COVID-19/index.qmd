In May 2021, during early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, a news outlet publicly identified a COVID-19 patient as a "gay man" who visited gay clubs in Itaewon, disclosing personal details. This led to significant online hate against the LGBTQ+ community, heightening fear of contracting COVID-19 within this group. Using the Minority Stress Model ([Meyer, 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2072932/))[^1], this project investigates how **minority stressors**, such as the perceived threat of COVID-19, affect contextual factors like internalized stigma and contribute to mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ people. Also, I aim to examine the moderating role of **protective factors**, such as community connectedness, in these relationships.

I will use data from the *2021 Youth LGBTQ+ People's Social Needs and Status Survey* ([Jeong et al., 2021](https://www.dawoom-t4c.org/397d4ebb-6ad4-4525-9b71-9706f13a5e8b))[^2], which surveyed 3,911 LGBTQ+ people aged 19-34 in South Korea. For analysis, I will use SPSS 27.0, Mplus, and R to test the mediating effects of minority stressors and the moderating effects of protective factors.
