![Decent education within PWT model (Duffy et al., 2022)](/assets/images/decentedu.png){style="text-align: center" width="600"}

The recent expanded model of the Psychology of Working Theory (PWT; [Duffy et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879122000823))[^1] incorporates the concept of **decent education** to better understand how education influences career outcomes and overall well-being. Decent education refers not only to formal education but also to skills, training, and learning opportunities that help individuals secure stable and meaningful work. The expanded model highlights that decent education provides individuals with the necessary resources, knowledge, and skills to navigate the job market effectively.

We applied the expanded model of the PWT to young people in South Korea. The goal was to examine whether the pathways to obtaining decent work, as outlined by the theory, differ between young men and women. Specifically, we investigated whether work volition and career adaptability mediate the relationship between decent education and decent work. We used data from the *Youth Panel Survey 2021* ([Hwang et al., 2021](https://survey.keis.or.kr/eng/yp/yp01.jsp))[^2] and focused on 3,403 Korean young adults currently employed as regular workers (정규직 in Korean). The group included 1,901 women and 1,502 men, with an average age of 25.32 years.
