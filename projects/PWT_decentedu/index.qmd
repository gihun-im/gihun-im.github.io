![Decent education within PWT model (Duffy et al., 2022)](decentedu.png){style="text-align: center" fig-align="center" width="600"}

The recent expansion of the psychology of working theory (PWT; [Duffy et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879122000823))[^1] introduces the concept of **decent education** to more fully explain how educational experiences influence career outcomes and overall well-being. Decent education encompasses not only formal schooling but also access to skill development, vocational training, and other learning opportunities that enable individuals to secure stable and meaningful employment. Within this framework, decent education functions as a foundation that equips people with the resources, knowledge, and competencies needed to navigate the labor market effectively.

In this study, we applied the expanded PWT model to young adults in South Korea to examine whether pathways to decent work differ by gender. Our analysis focused on whether work volition and career adaptability mediate the link between decent education and decent work. Data were drawn from the *Youth Panel Survey 2021* ([Hwang et al., 2021](https://survey.keis.or.kr/eng/yp/yp01.jsp))[^2], which included 3,403 Korean young adults employed in regular positions (정규직 in Korean). The sample comprised 1,901 women and 1,502 men, with a mean age of 25.32 years.
