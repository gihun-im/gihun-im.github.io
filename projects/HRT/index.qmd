Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a critical component of [Gender-Affirming Care (GAC)](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf). Despite a growing demand for HRT and GAC in recent years, these services are often insufficiently covered by insurance. Additionally, a significant proportion of gender diverse adults remain uninsured, further restricting access.

Research has identified multiple barriers to accessing HRT/GAC. These barriers include both direct and indirect costs, such as out-of-pocket expenses and supplementary costs associated with obtaining care. Other reported challenges include a lack of quality care availability, fear of provider discrimination, and prior negative healthcare experiences.

[Andersen's (1995)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2137284)[^1] model explains healthcare utilization patterns through the interplay of environmental and personal factors, perceived and objective needs, and enabling resources. [Gelberg et al. (2000)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1089079/)[^2] later expanded this framework to account for factors unique to vulnerable populations.

Existing studies have documented barriers faced by gender-diverse adults in accessing HRT/GAC, but most have relied on qualitative methods. While these studies provide valuable insights, their findings lack confirmation through broader quantitative approaches. Additionally, the majority of participants in these studies were White, limiting the exploration of predisposing factors such as race and disability. To address these gaps, this project will examine the relationships among HRT access, financial trade-offs, and perceptions of safety and discrimination in a diverse sample of gender diverse people.
