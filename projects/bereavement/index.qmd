Since the 2015 legalization of same-sex marraige in the U.S., both social attitudes and legal structures have reshaped the landscape of LGBTQ+ partner loss. Building on [Bristowe et al.’s (2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269216316634601)[^1] systematic review, we examined research on LGBTQ+ bereavement published after 2015.

[^1]: Bristowe, K., Marshall, S., & Harding, R. (2016). The bereavement experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or trans\* people who have lost a partner: A systematic review, thematic synthesis and modelling of the literature. *Palliative Medicine*, *30*(8), 730-744.

We followed [PRISMA guidelines](https://www.prisma-statement.org) and screened 1,656 studies from the Psychology Database and PubMed, ultimately including 10 qualitative studies. Through thematic analysis, we identified common bereavement reactions and LGBTQ+-specific experiences. The findings highlight the ongoing need for professional training and interventions that address the unique aspects of bereavement among LGBTQ+ people, even amid broader legal and social recognition.
